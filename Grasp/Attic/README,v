2.1
log
@Finally got rid of all the sticky tags. I will never use the
again! Also added README file to directory Testing.
And I modified cut offs in testa, testb and testc so that
they all do the same simulation.

Finally, I put in a check that cut-off be less than
half box-width for force fields not using neighbor list.

(Still need to add this to threebody and external force fields)

@This file contains instructions for compiling
and testing GRASP on your machine.

For more information on the code, see Documentation/manual.txt.

The GRASP source code and examples in this distribution
can be compiled and run using the make command.
This distribution contains two make files. 

Makefile is the generic version, intended for Linux 
workstations, Linux clusters and the like.  The 
following variables are system specific:

	MPI_PATH - The root directory for the MPI installation
	GRASPDIR - The directory containing the directory Source

Once these are set, you should be able to compile the
binary grasp.exe by moving to the direcotry Source and typing

	make all

To run a test example, type 

	make testa

The results of the example will be written to Grasp/Testing/testa.


Makefile.cplant is customized for use on Cplant.   The 
following variables are user specific:

	GRASPDIR - The directory containing the directory Source
	ENFSDIR - The directory Testing on the enfs filesystem

Once these are set, you should be able to compile the
binary grasp.exe by moving to the directory Source and typing

	make all

To run a test example, first copy the directory Testing to
the enfs filesystem, and make sure ENFSDIR in Makefile.cplant
matches the new location.  Then go to the directory Source
and type 

	make testa

The results of the example will be written to $(ENFSDIR)/testa.
