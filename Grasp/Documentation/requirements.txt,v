@Objective
Scalable MD code which supports implementation of a wide range of new physics models

Key Features (* indicates completed item).
*O(N) Non-bond Scaling (Neighbor lists)
*O (N/P) Non-bond Parallel Scaling (Spatial decomposition)
*Multibody interactions (EAM, MEAM, Stillinger-Weber)
Dynamic connection table
Bond order potentials
Resonance/Conjugation Energy
Charge transfer (Linear Solve, Minimization, Car-Parrinello)
Point dipoles, multipoles
Molecular methods (stress, charge equilibration)
*Non-orthorhombic (triclinic) simulation cell
*Cut-offs extending out to arbitrary number of periodic cells
Cross interaction between force fields.
Interface with external force modules (TB, DFT,...)
NVE, NVT, NPT ensembles

@This is starting point for verison 2.0.
The functionality is unchanged, even slightly degraded,
as some items have not yet been converted, primarily
output features such as energy conservation.

The compartmentalization between different operations has
been greatly enhanced.

Performance is unchanged.
