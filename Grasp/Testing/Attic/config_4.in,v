@Finally finished implementing Stillinger-Weber forcefield
Increased number of examples to six. The LJ and SW force
fields have been tested for energy conservation, and so are
have high confidence.

The first three are short MD runs using perturbed FCC LJ systems.
The fourth is an energy evaluation of a dense tetrahedral
Stillinger-Weber Silicon crystal, which matches a TOWHEE example
to seven decimal places.
The fifth and sixth are short MD runs using perturbed tetrahedral
Stillinger-Weber Silicon.
