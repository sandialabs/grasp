@Implemented a new forcefield type: Class Force_External
This is designed primarily for external force fields with
simple geometric forms, such as the Lennard-Jones 9-3 wall,
although it might also be used for a set of fixed atoms.

Currently, the only types implemented are lj93_cut and lj93_cut_shift.
These work for both arbitrary cut-off neighbor list and also
within the minimum image convention (although this is not used
by external force field with only truncated interactions.

Periodic boundary conditions are applied in all directions.

Initialization and output of velocities have also been added.
