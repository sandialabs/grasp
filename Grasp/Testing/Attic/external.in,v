@# This is a test problem for the lj93 type external field
# It generates a set of periodic walls normal to the y direction
# of type Yeehaw! and another set normal to the z direction of
# type Heehaw!. It was chosen to work with a 2x2x2 periodic
# box containing four atoms in the fcc positions.
# Note the crazy positions of the "central" image walls.
# These get shifted to the actual central box, so that all
# interactions are calculated correctly.

@This is just an updated set of data files for the test suite.
Important additions are the dft (density profile) run,
the relax (steepest descent energy minimization) run, and
the 2tet_sw_cut run, which gives identical energies to
the 250tet_sw_cut run, using only 2 instead of 250 particles.
