@# This is a test problem for the lj93 type external field
# It generates a set of periodic walls normal to the y direction
# of type Yeehaw! and another set normal to the z direction of
# type Heehaw!. It was chosen to work with a 2x2x2 periodic
# box containing four atoms in the fcc positions.
# Note the crazy positions of the "central" image walls.
# These get shifted to the actual central box, so that all
# interactions are calculated correctly.

@Implemented a new forcefield type: Class Force_External
This is designed primarily for external force fields with
simple geometric forms, such as the Lennard-Jones 9-3 wall,
although it might also be used for a set of fixed atoms.

Currently, the only types implemented are lj93_cut and lj93_cut_shift.
These work for both arbitrary cut-off neighbor list and also
within the minimum image convention (although this is not used
by external force field with only truncated interactions.

Periodic boundary conditions are applied in all directions.

Initialization and output of velocities have also been added.
