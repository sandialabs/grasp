@Fixed up the output log immensely. Fixed up the velocity-rescale
thermostat, which changed the dft example a little.
Other than that, all the other examples (NVE) stayed the same.

@This is another example demonstrating use of reduced units
and LJ93 walls and density profile to compare with dft
calculations.

@New input and output for old examples reflects two important changes:

1. Created a full command interface with input commands echoed to output.
2. Fixed bug in evaluation of kinetic energy so that report error
	in total energy is now much, much smaller. Before we were
	evaluating kinetic energy at t-delt/2 and potential energy at t.

@Implemented a new forcefield type: Class Force_External
This is designed primarily for external force fields with
simple geometric forms, such as the Lennard-Jones 9-3 wall,
although it might also be used for a set of fixed atoms.

Currently, the only types implemented are lj93_cut and lj93_cut_shift.
These work for both arbitrary cut-off neighbor list and also
within the minimum image convention (although this is not used
by external force field with only truncated interactions.

Periodic boundary conditions are applied in all directions.

Initialization and output of velocities have also been added.
