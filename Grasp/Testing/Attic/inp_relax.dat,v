@Fixed up the output log immensely. Fixed up the velocity-rescale
thermostat, which changed the dft example a little.
Other than that, all the other examples (NVE) stayed the same.

2.1
log
@This is just an updated set of data files for the test suite.
Important additions are the dft (density profile) run,
the relax (steepest descent energy minimization) run, and
the 2tet_sw_cut run, which gives identical energies to
the 250tet_sw_cut run, using only 2 instead of 250 particles.
