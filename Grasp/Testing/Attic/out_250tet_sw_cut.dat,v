@This is just an updated set of data files for the test suite.
Important additions are the dft (density profile) run,
the relax (steepest descent energy minimization) run, and
the 2tet_sw_cut run, which gives identical energies to
the 250tet_sw_cut run, using only 2 instead of 250 particles.

@New input and output for old examples reflects two important changes:

1. Created a full command interface with input commands echoed to output.
2. Fixed bug in evaluation of kinetic energy so that report error
	in total energy is now much, much smaller. Before we were
	evaluating kinetic energy at t-delt/2 and potential energy at t.

@Implemented a new forcefield type: Class Force_External
This is designed primarily for external force fields with
simple geometric forms, such as the Lennard-Jones 9-3 wall,
although it might also be used for a set of fixed atoms.

Currently, the only types implemented are lj93_cut and lj93_cut_shift.
These work for both arbitrary cut-off neighbor list and also
within the minimum image convention (although this is not used
by external force field with only truncated interactions.

Periodic boundary conditions are applied in all directions.

Initialization and output of velocities have also been added.

@Finally finished implementing Stillinger-Weber forcefield
Increased number of examples to six. The LJ and SW force
fields have been tested for energy conservation, and so are
have high confidence.

The first three are short MD runs using perturbed FCC LJ systems.
The fourth is an energy evaluation of a dense tetrahedral
Stillinger-Weber Silicon crystal, which matches a TOWHEE example
to seven decimal places.
The fifth and sixth are short MD runs using perturbed tetrahedral
Stillinger-Weber Silicon.
