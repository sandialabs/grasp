@The primary change is the addition of the embedded atom method (EAM)
This is contained in the class Force_Eam. An example is contained
in the directory Testing/testl.

I also tweaked various parts of the code:
-Added epsilon shift to unit cell origin to avoid
pathologies associated with origin at zero
-Changed ndof from 3n to 3n-3
-Implemented localptr usertag arrays in class ParticleList
This enables user to pick whatever integer tags they want for
atoms, but the code generates internal tags 0,1,....nparticles_tot-1.
-Random velocities are now generated for all nparticles_tot particles,
but only assigned to local particles, so that velocity assignments
are independent of number of processors used.
-I got rid of the dreaded COSP neighboring scheme
-I added an example of Nose-Hoover thermostat in testm
-I added a warning for when force field type has no particle type match.
