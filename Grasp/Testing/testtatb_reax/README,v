@If you want to generate reax run to compare with testtatb, you
should use exe_Nov2006_tatb, but first:

cp geo_tatb geo
cp control_tatb control
cp ffield_tatb ffield

Then;

./exe_Nov2006_tatb

Afterwards, look at fort.71 and fort.73 for energy info. The reac.f source
file should have been modified so that the trajectory matches that from
GRASP very closely (~0.001 kcal/mol excepts for effect of energy 
discontinuities). As a reference, fort_tatb.71 and fort_tatb.73 
are under CVS control.

If you want to look closely at forces and energies for the first timestep,
do:

cp geo_detail geo
cp control_detail control
cp ffield_tatb ffield

This computes initial forces and energies without charges and without periodic
boundary conditions. The forces are printed to fort.66.
